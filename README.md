# profile

I turned an old profile page into my new portfoilo! 
Rather than wasting old resources I thought I could turn something that had some senitmental signifgance 
into something I could be proud of.
I created this using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. I added the scroll effect using Fullage.js.
This will be a living project as I will add more as I keep creating more projects.
If you have any inquires please contact me via email Ayub.Bey@gmail.com
